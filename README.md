# IRKGL16
Implicit Runge-Kutta Gauss-Legendre 16th order
(implementation in Julia)

## Description

We present a Julia implementation of a 16th order Implicit Runge-Kutta integrator IRKGL16 (a 8-
stage IRK scheme based on Gauss-Legendre nodes) for high accuracy numerical integration of non-
stiff ODE systems. Our algorithm supports adaptive timesteping,mixed precision and multithreading to
solve problems fast and more accuracy

The family of implicit Runge-Kutta schemes based on collocation with Gauss-Legendre nodes are
known to be symplectic and super-convergent (order 2s for the method with s internal nodes), and
thus very convenient for the high precision numerical integration of Hamiltonian systems with
constant time-step size. For non-stiff problems, implementations based on fixed-point iterations are
recommended

We believe that, for general (non-necessarily Hamiltonian) non-stiff ODE systems, such implicit
Runge-Kutta methods (implemented with fixed point iteration) can be very competitive for high
precision computations (for accuracy requirements that exceeds double precision arithmetic)


## Installation

This package can be installed using

```julia
using Pkg
Pkg.add("https://github.com/mikelehu/IRKGaussLegendre.jl")
using IRKGaussLegendre
```

## Example: Burrau's problem of three bodies

Three point masses attract each other according to the Newtonian law of gravitation. The masses of the particles are
m1=3, m2=4, and m3=5; they are initially located at the apexes of a right triangle with sides 3, 4, and 5, so that the
corresponding masses and sides are opposite. The particles are free to move in the plane of the triangle and are at rest initially.


## Step 1: Defining  the problem

To solve this numerically, we define a problem type by giving it the equation, the initial
condition, and the timespan to solve over:


```julia
function NbodyODE!(du,u,Gm,t)
     N = length(Gm)
     du[1,:,:] .= 0
     for i in 1:N
        qi = u[2,:,i]
        Gmi = Gm[i]
        du[2,:,i] = u[1,:,i]
        for j in (i+1):N
           qj = u[2,:,j]
           Gmj = Gm[j]
           qij = qi - qj
           auxij = (qij[1]*qij[1]+qij[2]*qij[2]+qij[3]*qij[3])^(-3/2)
           du[1,:,i] -= Gmj*auxij*qij
           du[1,:,j] += Gmi*auxij*qij
        end
     end

    return
end
```

```julia
Gm = [5, 4, 3]
q=[1,-1,0,-2,-1,0,1,3,0]
v=zeros(size(q))
q0 = reshape(q,3,:)
v0 = reshape(v,3,:)
u0 = Array{Float64}(undef,2,3,N)
u0[1,:,:] = v0
u0[2,:,:] = q0
tspan = (0.0,63.0)
prob=ODEProblem(NbodyODE!,u0,tspan,Gm);
```

## Step 2: Solving the problem


After defining a problem, you solve it using solve

```julia
sol1=solve(prob,IRKGL16(),reltol=1e-12, abstol=1e-12);
```

## Step 3: Analyzing the solution

```julia
bodylist = ["Body-1", "Body-2", "Body-3"]
pl = plot(title="Burrau problem (Adaptive)",aspect_ratio=1)

ulist1 = sol1.u[1:end]
tlist1 = sol1.t[1:end]

for j = 1:3
 xlist  = map(u->u[2,1,j], ulist1)
 ylist  = map(u->u[2,2,j], ulist1)
 pl2 = plot!(xlist,ylist, label = bodylist[j])   
end  
plot(pl2)
```
